# AlloySecrets
Library and research facilitator. Will scan local and remote hosts as dictated by the user and save the metadata and a digest of uniq/important keywords and thier page number (and surrounding text if i feel like it) and fetch the relevent data. Hopefully it will condense and remove duplicate/superflous information and produce a condensed result. Will go out and query google if your library doesnt produce satisfactory results. Consdiering a speach playback option as well.

## Historic Event
This is Mark's first project both with BMN and overall, and is a good teaching project (and my second time professional mentoring of a junior engineer to learn to code + engineer from the ground up). An exciting and useful project and one to show off on a resume I think.
